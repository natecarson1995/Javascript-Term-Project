The purpose of this game is to breed plants selectively to get more favorable characteristics.
To do this, the user clicks to plants to breed, and goes on to the next generation.

The main problems are that the generation algorithm is still kind of naive, and not rooted in a lot of reality.

The major plans for future releases involve a better algorithm, and more intuitive interface to the breeding of plants.
Perhaps there could be some form of animations.
