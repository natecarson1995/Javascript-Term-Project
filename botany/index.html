        This game is simply called "botany".<br>
        The idea of this game is to work with your randomly generated plants<br>
        and breed them selectively until you have created the perfect, prosperous plant.<br>
        To do this, click two plants to breed, and hit the "next generation" button

        Congratulations, you were able to get a plant<br>
        that has an average >= 13 on each of its' characteristics!<br>
        This plant will form a great foundation for the farms here<br>
        and shall provide food for you and illuminate much of<br>
        the genealogy of this place.
