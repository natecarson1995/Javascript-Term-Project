The purpose of the game is to translate a well-known text from a generated language back to English.
To do this, the user clicks each word to select it, and then guesses at a replacement in the text box.
The word is then replaced with the user's guess, and colored green if it is correct.
To win, the user must translate the whole text back to English.

The main problems with the game are that there is no persistence to the user's guesses, and that
there is currently only one well-known text being loaded, as too many of them are incredibly hard to guess.

The first problem could be solved by storing some data in the user's local storage, the main thing is finding
out the format for that data. The second one could be solved by just looking through more stories and doing more research.

The major plans for future releases involve different "levels" of difficulty to the game. Perhaps picking more obscure
texts on each victory. The game could also use more natural looking "alien words". Sometimes the generator makes words that
are hard to pronounce.
