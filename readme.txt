This website is created as the term project for my CIT190 class at Northwestern Michigan College.

The index is a main menu connecting to three games.
All three follow a common theme of discovering a randomly generated world.

The first is about discovering random compounds and elements.
The second is about discovering random plants, their phenotypes, and genotypes.
The third is about discovering random words, and how they translate back to English.
