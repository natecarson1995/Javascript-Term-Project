The purpose of this game is to combine, separate, and fuse elements and compounds to create a large diversity.
To do this, the user drags elements and compounds into their various tools.
Their tools then do some sort of reaction to "create" other chemicals.

The main problems involve the lack of beautiful interface. Things are not very intuitive, and could use more prettifying.
In addition, the game is kind of repetitive and doesn't have many new mechanics in it.

The major plans for future releases involve more tools, and a better interface.
